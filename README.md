# dkeeper

Keeper is an application that leverages the power of React for the front-end and the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) for the back-end. Throughout the development process, I have implemented various features and functionalities to ensure a seamless user experience.

To begin, I configured the project to use React by following the necessary steps. Using the DFX framework, I created a new project called Keeper and initialized it with React templates. This allowed me to harness the capabilities of React for building the user interface of the application.

Next, I focused on the back-end implementation using the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). By utilizing the DFX framework, I established communication between the front-end and the canisters on the Internet Computer. This enabled the storage, retrieval, deletion, and persistence of data on the canisters.
